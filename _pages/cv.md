    * Conducted interdisciplinary research in the design and implementation of the SMASH  system to help understanding the influence of various factors on sustained weight loss, in collaboration with doctors, scientists and researchers from PeaceHealth Medical Group, SKT Americas, NIH and University of Oregon
    * Designed and implemented privacy preserving data analysis algorithms (eight publications). For my doctoral dissertation, I investigate how to protect privacy in analyzing sensitive data with various mining models. We develop privacy preserving mining techniques for analyzing sensitive data from social network, wearable devices, health record platforms, considering various potential attacking methods from adversaries. Our developed techniques can be applied to many commonly used data mining approaches such as general OLAP queries, regression analysis, spectral analysis, Bayesian inference, deep learning models and so on.
